# DBS Stockprice Prediction App
The following project is a deployment of a Linear Regressor model used to predict the share price of DBS Bank with relation to the value of the Singapore Dollar against the US Dollar.
The app is deployed on Streamlit cloud, making use of the Streamlit UI python package.

Streamlit can be installed on a local machine as a python package as follows: `pip install streamlit`. Refer to the streamit documentation [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/) on how to create a simple UI webpage using the python package, such as adding buttons, user input fields, and even charts.


The app is then pushed to a Github repository, and deployed to Streamlit Cloud.

You can find the instructions to deploy the app [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-cloud/get-started/deploy-an-app). The process is very quick.

Be sure to specify the main file path as the pthon file that will be running streamlit (in my case, its heroku.py)
Ensure that the repo has a requirements.txt file with the required python packages.
